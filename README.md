# monitor_tickets_sale_start

I wanted to check if the tickets sale for the champions league games where maccabi haifa plays has started.
Currently the site displays a message says it hasn't stated yet, so here is a script to send me an email when this message on their site has changed,
so i will be able to quickly go into the site and purchase tickets.
Since a lot of people will probably want to enter and buy the tickets, this script might help me to enter first.
